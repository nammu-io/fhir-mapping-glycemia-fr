**Mapping FHIR R4**

1.Identify the FHIR resources:
Identify which FHIR resources correspond to the data in your CSV file. For example, Patient, Observation, etc. In this particular case we use this particular example [https://interop.esante.gouv.fr/ig/fhir/mesures/3.0.1/Observation-ExampleMesObservationGlucose001.json.html]

2.Create a mapping: Define a mapping from your CSV data to the FHIR resources. This could be a simple 1-to-1 mapping, or more complex transformations depending on your data.

3.Transform the data: Use a tool or write a script to apply the mapping and transform your CSV data into FHIR format.

There are several tools and libraries available that can help with this process.Here are a couple of GitHub repositories that might be useful:

**toFHIR**: This is an easy-to-use data mapping and high-performant data transformation tool to transform existing datasets from various types of sources to HL7 FHIR. It can read from various data sources such as a file system, relational database, streaming inputs like Apache Kafka or a FHIR Server. Link to he corresponding github repo [https://github.com/srdc/tofhir].

**FHIR-Converter**: This is a conversion utility to translate legacy data formats into FHIR. The FHIR converter supports the following conversions: HL7v2 to FHIR, C-CDA to FHIR, JSON to FHIR, FHIR STU3 to R4, and FHIR to HL7v2 (Preview). The converter uses templates that define mappings between these different data formats.Link to he corresponding github repo [https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter].
